The provided code builds a simple user dashboard web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes multiple pages such as a login page (login.html), registration page (register.html), dashboard (dashboard.html), and profile update page (profile.html). The login and registration forms collect user input and handle form submission using JavaScript, with login validation (mocked), user session data stored in localStorage, and redirection to the dashboard after a successful login. The dashboard dynamically displays the user's name, last login time, a mock activity feed, and a friend list. The JavaScript file (app.js) manages form handling, user authentication, and dynamic content rendering. Basic styling in styles.css is applied to ensure a clean, centered layout for each page.
